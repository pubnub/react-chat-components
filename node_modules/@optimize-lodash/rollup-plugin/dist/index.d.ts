 * Note that only specific named imports are supported, unlike babel-plugin-lodash. For example,
 * this plugin will print a warning for this import and make no changes to the import:
 *
 * `import _ from "lodash";`
 *
 * Optionally, set `useLodashEs` to true and `lodash` imports will be converted to `lodash-es`
 * imports. Note that it's up to user to include the `lodash-es` module and ensure the output
 * is set to some form of `es`/`esm`/`module` (other output formats will error). An example:
 *
 * `import { isNil } from "lodash";` -> `import { isNil } from "lodash-es";`
 *
 * @param include files/globs to include with this plugin (optional)
 * @param exclude files/globs to exclude from this plugin (optional)
 * @param useLodashEs set `true` to convert imports to use "lodash-es" (optional; default false)
 * @param appendDotJs default `true`; set `false` if you don't want `.js` appended to CJS lodash imports
