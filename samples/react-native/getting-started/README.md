# Getting Started

`getting-started` is a simple app that allows you to get a 1:1 chat app quickly up and running
through the PubNub Network. It features a simple chat window with a message input field. After
starting the app, you can send sample messages as a default `myFirstUser` by typing them in an input
field and messages will pile up on the screen as you send them.
