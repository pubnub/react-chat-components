# React Chat Components

PubNub's Chat Components library provides easy-to-use components to build chat applications using
PubNub Chat on the React Framework. Our component library is the fastest way to add chat features
like direct and group messaging, typing indicators, reactions and more without going through the
complexity of low-level architecture of realtime networks. At the same time it allows you to create
apps for various use cases, with different functionalities and customizable looks.

# Usage

## PubNub Account

1. Sign in or create an account to create an app on the
   [Admin Portal](https://dashboard.pubnub.com/) and get the keys to use in your application.

2. When you create a new app, the first set of keys is generated automatically, but a single app can
   have as many keysets as you like. We recommend that you create separate keysets for production
   and test environments.

3. Some of the functionalities you might want to enable on your keyset depending on the use-case
   include _Presence_, _Files_, _Storage & Playback_ (including correct Retention Period) and
   _Objects_ (be sure to select a geographical region corresponding to most users of your
   application). The moderated-chat sample _requires_ these features are set in order to work with
   the
   [moderation dashboard](https://github.com/pubnub/moderation-dashboard/blob/master/how-to-design-modertable-app.md).

## Run Sample Apps

Start by exploring our [Sample Apps](https://pubnub.github.io/react-chat-components/samples) that
are built using chat components. Follow the steps below to run the apps locally in your own
environment.

1. Clone the repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/pubnub/react-chat-components.git
```

2. Go to the `samples` folder:

```bash
cd react-chat-components/samples
```

3. Install the dependencies:

```bash
npm install
```

4. Follow steps from the
   [PubNub Account section](https://github.com/pubnub/react-chat-components/blob/master/lib/README.md#pubnub-account)
   to create your own keys and paste them into `pubnub-keys.json`:

```bash
vi pubnub-keys.json
```

5. Pre-populate the User and Channel Object metadata (required only for the moderated-chat sample):

```bash
npm run setup
```

6. Run the application:

```bash
npm start
```

## Components Installation

Install the components and all required dependencies using npm:

```bash
npm install --save pubnub pubnub-react @pubnub/react-chat-components
```

## Components Usage

1. Import PubNub, PubNub React Provider and the components:

```js
import PubNub from "pubnub";
import { PubNubProvider } from "pubnub-react";
import {
  Chat,
  MessageList,
  MessageInput,
  ChannelList,
  MemberList,
} from "@pubnub/react-chat-components";
```

2. Create your PubNub client and rest of the configuration for the Chat, which serves as a common
   context for all of the components:

```jsx
const pubnub = new PubNub({
  publishKey: "myPublishKey",
  subscribeKey: "mySubscribeKey",
  uuid: "myUniqueUUID",
});
const currentChannel = "myCurrentChannel";
const theme = "light";
```

3. Feed the PubNub Provider with your newly created client as with other PubNub React applications:

```jsx
const MyComponent = () => {
  return <PubNubProvider client={pubnub}></PubNubProvider>;
};
```

4. Place the components within the Chat state provider in any order that your app requires.
   Components can be tweaked later on using option properties and CSS variables:

```jsx
const MyComponent = () => {
  return (
    <PubNubProvider client={pubnub}>
      <Chat {...{ currentChannel, theme }}>
        <MessageList />
        <MessageInput />
      </Chat>
    </PubNubProvider>
  );
};
```

5. Check out the
   [PubNub Chat Components Documentation](https://pubnub.github.io/react-chat-components/docs) to
   learn more about how to use the components and the
   [PubNub Chat Components Samples](https://pubnub.github.io/react-chat-components/samples) to see
   what is possible using the components. Source code of the sample applications can be found in the
   `samples` folder in the repository root.
