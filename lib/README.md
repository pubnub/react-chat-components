# PubNub Chat Components for React

PubNub Chat Components for React are the fastest way to add chat features like direct and group
messaging, typing indicators, reactions, without going through the complexity of low-level
architecture of realtime networks.

- **Reduced Implementation Time**. Develop proof-of-concept and production ready apps faster using
  predefined components.
- **Fast and Simple Extensibility**. Add rich features like typing indicators, read receipts,
  reactions etc. without writing complex code.
- **Flexible and Customizable Components**. Customize component design and add custom components to
  extend functionality.
- **High Scalability**. Let PubNub take care of scaling and reliability as you grow your app.
- **Easy Theming**. Use the built-in light and dark themes or create custom ones for various use
  cases: group, support, and event chats.
- **Strong Typing**. Utilize the power of TypeScript to develop your application.

  memberships from PubNub Objects storage using custom hooks

# Usage

Set up and use PubNub Chat Components for React to build your own chat application.

## Set up PubNub account

1. Sign in or create an account to create an app on the
   [Admin Portal](https://dashboard.pubnub.com/) and get the keys to use in your application.

2. When you create a new app, the first set of keys is generated automatically, but a single app can
   have as many keysets as you like. We recommend that you create separate keysets for production
   and test environments.

3. Some of the functionalities you might want to enable on your keyset depending on the use-case
   include _Presence_, _Files_, _Storage & Playback_ (including correct Retention Period) and
   _Objects_ (be sure to select a geographical region corresponding to most users of your
   application). The moderated-chat sample _requires_ these features are set in order to work with
   the
   [moderation dashboard](https://github.com/pubnub/moderation-dashboard/blob/master/how-to-design-modertable-app.md).

## Run Sample Apps

Start by exploring our [Sample Apps](https://pubnub.github.io/react-chat-components/samples) that
are built using chat components. Follow the steps below to run the apps locally in your own
environment.

1. Clone the repository.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/pubnub/react-chat-components.git
```

2. Go to the `samples` folder.

```bash
cd react-chat-components/samples
```

3. Install the dependencies.

```bash
npm install
```

4. Follow steps from the
   [PubNub Account section](https://github.com/pubnub/react-chat-components/blob/master/lib/README.md#pubnub-account)
   to create your own keys and paste them into `pubnub-keys.json`.

```bash
vi pubnub-keys.json
```

5. Pre-populate the User and Channel Object metadata (required only for the moderated-chat sample).

```bash
npm run setup
```

6. Run the application.

```bash
npm start
```

## Install and use components

1. Install the components and all required dependencies using npm.

```bash
npm install --save pubnub pubnub-react @pubnub/react-chat-components
```

2. Import PubNub, PubNub React Provider and the components.

```js
import PubNub from "pubnub";
import { PubNubProvider } from "pubnub-react";
import {
  Chat,
  MessageList,
  MessageInput,
  ChannelList,
  MemberList,
} from "@pubnub/react-chat-components";
```

3. Create your PubNub client and rest of the configuration for the Chat provider.

```jsx
const pubnub = new PubNub({
  publishKey: "myPublishKey",
  subscribeKey: "mySubscribeKey",
  uuid: "myUniqueUUID",
});
const currentChannel = "myCurrentChannel";
const theme = "light";
```

4. Feed the PubNub Provider with your newly created client as with other PubNub React applications.

```jsx
const MyComponent = () => {
  return <PubNubProvider client={pubnub}></PubNubProvider>;
};
```

5. Place the components within the Chat state provider in any order that your app requires.
   Components can be tweaked later on using option properties and CSS variables.

```jsx
const MyComponent = () => {
  return (
    <PubNubProvider client={pubnub}>
      <Chat {...{ currentChannel, theme }}>
        <MessageList />
        <MessageInput />
      </Chat>
    </PubNubProvider>
  );
};
```
