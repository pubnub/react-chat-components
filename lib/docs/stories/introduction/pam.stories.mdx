# Access Manager

Access Manager allows you to enforce security controls for client access to resources within the
PubNub network. Your servers can grant their clients access to individual PubNub resources
(channels, channel groups, and UUID metadata) for a limited duration, with the ability to renew
access or add permissions for additional resources.

With Access Manager enabled, your clients must have permissions to send requests to PubNub. You can
grant access to your clients from a secure server using the secretKey. These grants allow you to
granularly manage the resources available to each client. For instance, you can make a one-to-one
chat room private by only allowing the two users in that chat room to have read and write
permissions on the chat room channel. Alternatively, you can make a channel public by allowing all
users to have access to it.

For more information, refer to the
[Access Manager feature description](https://www.pubnub.com/docs/security/access-control).

## Access Manager handling in components

PubNub Chat Components as a purely client-side React components library does not do anything
specific to handle Access Manager internally. Once it is enabled on the PubNub keyset, the developer
is expected to write custom code that would handle granting, just as if the app was written from
scratch.

You can expect the operations listed below to be executed internally by the components. To work
properly, all of them should be granted access to the UUID passed to the PubNub instance.

## Operations to permissions mapping

The following tables show the mappings of API operations to resources and permissions.
