# Emoji pickers

The following components interact with emoji pickers:

- `MessageInput` uses emojis to compose text messages.
- `MessageList` uses emojis to react to text messages.

To keep the components library lightweight and provide maximum customizability, an emoji picker
component is not included directly in the package. Instead, it's expected to be installed directly
in your application and provided into `react-chat-components` using render props.

## Interface

To use any emoji picker component of your choosing, it has to expose the `onSelect()` method which
is called whenever an emoji is picked by the user. In that method, you must provide a single object
argument which has the `native` property that returns a native emoji image that can be rendered by
your app's supported browser.

A TypeScript interface that you can import from the components looks like this:

```tsx
interface EmojiPickerElementProps {
  onSelect?: ({ native: string }) => void;
}
```

## Use `emoji-mart`

[emoji-mart](https://www.npmjs.com/package/emoji-mart) is a very popular, customizable emoji picker
component for React that is natively supported by PubNub Chat Components for React. It uses the same
interface so the usage is plug-and-play.

1. Start by installing the package.

```bash
npm install --save emoji-mart
```

1. Import the component and required styles.

```tsx
import { Picker } from "emoji-mart";
import "emoji-mart/css/emoji-mart.css";
```

1. Use it in your chat app.

```tsx
<Chat channel="channel">
  <MessageList enableReactions reactionsPicker={<Picker />} />
  <MessageInput typingIndicator emojiPicker={<Picker />} />
</Chat>
```

## Use `emoji-picker-react`

[emoji-picker-react](https://www.npmjs.com/package/emoji-picker-react) is another popular choice to
provide emoji picking functionality. However, it uses a different interface so you have to write an
adapter before rendering it in the components.

1. Start by installing the package.

```bash
npm install --save emoji-picker-react
```

1. Import the component (and a helpful interface if you are using TypeScript).

```tsx
import Picker, { IEmojiData } from "emoji-picker-react";
import { EmojiPickerElementProps } from "@pubnub/react-chat-components";
```

1. Implement an adapter.

```tsx
export const PickerAdapter = (props: EmojiPickerElementProps) => {
  // handling method should call onSelect with an object exposing the "native" property
  const handleEmoji = (event: React.MouseEvent, emoji: IEmojiData) => {
    if (props.onSelect) props.onSelect({ native: emoji.emoji });
  };
  // onEmojiClick is a method in emoji-picker-react used to handle emoji picking
  return <Picker onEmojiClick={handleEmoji} />;
};
```

1. Use it in your chat app.

```tsx
<Chat channel="channel">
  <MessageList enableReactions reactionsPicker={<PickerAdapter />} />
  <MessageInput typingIndicator emojiPicker={<PickerAdapter />} />
</Chat>
```
