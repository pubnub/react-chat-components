# User and channel metadata

Some components require providing lists of channels and users that should be displayed. Some of
those work fine with simple lists of `strings`, although look much better when provided with
metadata about the entities. See the reference below to understand what's expected where and why:

| Component         | Description                                                                                                           | Property                       | Data type (see below)           |
| :---------------- | :-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | :----------------------------- | ------------------------------- |
| `ChannelList`     | Displays channel names with descriptions.                                                                             | `channels`                     | `string[]` or `ChannelEntity[]` |
| `MemberList`      | Displays full user names, avatars and an additional line of text that can serve as a user's description/title/status. | `members`                      | `string[]` or `UserEntity[]`    |
| `MessageList`     | Displays full user names and avatars.                                                                                 | `users` of the `Chat` provider | `UserEntity[]`                  |
| `TypingIndicator` | Displays full user names or avatars, depending on the type of the indicator.                                          | `users` of the `Chat` provider | `UserEntity[]`                  |

## Data source

PubNub infrastructure allows you to store information about channels, users and memberships between
the two, using **Objects** feature. Even though all of the metadata has to be explicitly provided,
you can feed the data to the components from any source. Hence, it's possible to create chat
applications with completely serverless architecture. For more information, refer to the following:

- [Blog Post](https://www.pubnub.com/blog/introducing-objects-v2-store-for-user-and-channel-metadata/)
- [JavaScript SDK](https://www.pubnub.com/docs/sdks/javascript/api-reference/objects)

Once metadata is created and stored on PubNub servers, it's possible to easily fetch it and pass it
to the components using our custom
[React hooks](https://pubnub.github.io/react-chat-components/docs/?path=/docs/custom-hooks-about--page).

### Channel data type

```jsx
interface ChannelEntity {
  id: string; // used as an unique channel identifier across the components
  name: string; // displayed on the ChannelList (first line)
  description?: string; // displayed on the ChannelList (second line)
  custom?: {
    // not used in Chat Components by default, but can store additional data
    profileUrl?: string | null, // expects an image URL to display the channel thumbnail
    [key: string]: unknown,
  };
}
```

### User data type

```jsx
interface UserEntity {
  id: string;                  // used as an unique user identifier across the components
  name: string;                // displayed on Messages, Typing Indicator, and Member List
  profileUrl?: string | null;  // expects an image URL to display the user avatar
  externalId?: string | null;  // not used in Chat Components
  email?: string | null;       // not used in Chat Components
  eTag: string;                // not used in Chat Components
  created: string;             // not used in Chat Components
  updated: string;             // not used in Chat Components
  custom?: {
    title?: string             // displays user title / description / status on the member list
    [key: string]: unknown;    // can store additional data
  };
}

```
