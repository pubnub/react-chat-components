# Getting Started

See how you can get a 1:1 chat app up and running.

You will download a sample React app that uses two PubNub Chat Components for React:
[Message Input](https://pubnub.github.io/react-chat-components/docs/?path=/docs/components-message-input--default)
and
[Message List](https://pubnub.github.io/react-chat-components/docs/?path=/docs/components-message-list--default).
Then, you'll run the app and send your first message by typing it in the message input field. The
messages will pile up on the screen as you send them.

## Prerequisites

- [npm](https://docs.npmjs.com/cli/v6/commands/npm-install)
- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/download/)
- Code editor (e.g. [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/download))

> **TIP**: This guide uses [React v16.8+](https://www.npmjs.com/package/react/v/16.8.0),
> [ReactDOM v16.8+](https://www.npmjs.com/package/react-dom),
> [PubNub JavaScript SDK v4.29+](https://www.pubnub.com/docs/sdks/javascript/), and
> [PubNub React SDK v2.1.0+](https://www.pubnub.com/docs/chat/react/setup).

## Steps

<br />

### Create a PubNub account

Before you start, get **Publish Key** and **Subscribe Key** for your chat app.

To do that, sign in or create an account on the [Admin Portal](https://dashboard.pubnub.com/). The
autogenerated Demo Keyset already contains the configuration required to complete this guide.

<p>

> **TIP**: When you create a new app on the Admin Portal, the first set of keys is generated
> automatically, but a single app can have as many keysets as you like. We recommend that you create
> separate keysets for production and test environments. There are some of the functionalities you
> might need to enable on your keyset depending on the use case, but they won't be required to
> complete this guide. These options include:

- [**PRESENCE**](https://www.pubnub.com/docs/sdks/javascript/api-reference/presence) to monitor the
  subscribers of channels and delivers information on their real-time status
- [**STORAGE & PLAYBACK**](https://www.pubnub.com/docs/sdks/javascript/api-reference/storage-and-playback)
  (including correct **Retention**) to persist all messages as they're published.
- [**OBJECTS**](https://www.pubnub.com/docs/sdks/javascript/api-reference/objects) to easily store
  metadata about your application users and channels, and their membership associations, without the
  need to stand up your own databases. When using this feature, make sure you select a geographical
  region corresponding to most users of your application and to have these enabled: **User Metadata
  Events**, **Channel Metadata Events**, and **Membership Events**.

### Run the chat app

Now that you have your keyset, you can set up a chat app in two ways:

<Tabs>
<Tab label="Download starter">

1. Download the `getting-started` app.

<a
  href="https://github.com/pubnub/react-chat-components/archive/refs/heads/master.zip"
  target="_blank"
  style={{
    backgroundColor: "#1EA7FD",
    border: "none",
    padding: "8px 15px",
    color: "white",
    borderRadius: 3,
    marginTop: 10,
    display: "inline-block",
  }}
>
  Download samples
</a>

2. Unpack the archive into the folder of your choice.

3. Open the terminal app and go to the `samples/getting-started` folder.

4. Install the dependencies.

```sh
npm install
```

5. Open the app in the code editor, navigate to the and `src/getting-started.tsx` file and replace
   `myPublishKey` and `mySubscribeKey` with your own Publish and Subscribe Keys from the keyset on
   the Admin Portal. To associate a sender/current user with the PubNub messages, it's required to
   configure the [`uuid`](/docs/connections/users-and-devices) parameter. If you wish, modify the
   default value for the chat user.

```jsx
publishKey: "myPublishKey",
subscribeKey: "mySubscribeKey",
uuid: "myFirstUser",
```

The complete `getting-started.tsx` file looks as follows:

```jsx
/* Imports PubNub JavaScript and React SDKs to create and access PubNub instance accross your app. */
/* Imports the required PubNub Chat Components to easily create chat apps with PubNub. */
import React from "react";
import PubNub from "pubnub";
import { PubNubProvider } from "pubnub-react";
import { Chat, MessageList, MessageInput } from "@pubnub/react-chat-components";

/* Creates and configures your PubNub instance. Be sure to replace "myPublishKey" and "mySubscribeKey"
  with your own keyset. If you wish, modify the default "myFirstUser" uuid value for the chat user. */
const pubnub = new PubNub({
  publishKey: "myPublishKey",
  subscribeKey: "mySubscribeKey",
  uuid: "myFirstUser",
});
const currentChannel = "Default";
const theme = "light";

function App(): JSX.Element {
  return (
    <PubNubProvider client={pubnub}>
      {/* PubNubProvider is a part of the PubNub React SDK and allows you to access PubNub instance
        in components down the tree. */}
      <Chat {...{ currentChannel, theme }}>
        {/* Chat is an obligatory state provider. It allows you to configure some common component
          options, like the current channel and the general theme for the app. */}
        <MessageList />
        <MessageInput />
      </Chat>
    </PubNubProvider>
  );
}

export default App;
```

6. Back in the terminal, run the app on the dev server.

```sh
npm start
```

</Tab>
<Tab label="Extend existing app">

1. Open the terminal in the location of your app files and add the PubNub JavaScript SDK, React
   framework packages, and PubNub Chat Components for React.

```sh
npm install --save pubnub pubnub-react @pubnub/react-chat-components
```

2. Open your application source files in your favorite code editor. Copy over the snippet below into
   your app source file (e.g. `src/App.tsx`). Remember to place your own keys from the Admin Portal
   for the `publishKey` and `subscribeKey` parameters in the PubNub instance configuration.

```jsx
/* Imports PubNub JavaScript and React SDKs to create and access PubNub instance accross your app. */
/* Imports the required PubNub Chat Components to easily create chat apps with PubNub. */
import React from "react";
import PubNub from "pubnub";
import { PubNubProvider } from "pubnub-react";
import { Chat, MessageList, MessageInput } from "@pubnub/react-chat-components";

/* Creates and configures your PubNub instance. Be sure to replace "myPublishKey" and "mySubscribeKey"
with your own keyset. If you wish, modify the default "myFirstUser" uuid value for the chat user. */
const pubnub = new PubNub({
  publishKey: "myPublishKey",
  subscribeKey: "mySubscribeKey",
  uuid: "myFirstUser",
});
const currentChannel = "Default";
const theme = "light";

function App(): JSX.Element {
  return (
    <PubNubProvider client={pubnub}>
      {/* PubNubProvider is a part of the PubNub React SDK and allows you to access PubNub instance
      in components down the tree. */}
      <Chat {...{ currentChannel, theme }}>
        {/* Chat is an obligatory state provider. It allows you to configure some common component
        options, like the current channel and the general theme for the app. */}
        <MessageList />
        <MessageInput />
      </Chat>
    </PubNubProvider>
  );
}

export default App;
```

3. Run your app on the dev server.

```sh
npm start
```

</Tab>
</Tabs>

<br />

### Send your first message

1. Open the dev server at the default address [localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000).

2. Type and send your first message. The messages will pile up on the screen as you send them.
