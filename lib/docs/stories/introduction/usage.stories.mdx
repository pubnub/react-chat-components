# Usage

Set up and use PubNub Chat Components for React to build your own chat application.

## Requirements

- React v16.8+ and ReactDOM v16.8+
- [PubNub JavaScript SDK v4.29+](https://www.pubnub.com/docs/sdks/javascript/)
- [PubNub React SDK v2.1.0+](https://www.pubnub.com/docs/chat/react/setup)

## Set up PubNub account

1. Sign in or create an account to create an app on the
   [Admin Portal](https://dashboard.pubnub.com/) and get the keys to use in your application.

2. When you create a new app, the first set of keys is generated automatically, but a single app can
   have as many keysets as you like. We recommend that you create separate keysets for production
   and test environments.

3. Some of the functionalities you might want to enable on your keyset depending on the use-case
   include _Presence_, _Storage & Playback_ (including correct Retention) and _Objects_ (be sure to
   select a geographical region corresponding to most users of your application).

## Install and use components

1. Install the components and all required dependencies using npm.

```bash
npm install --save pubnub pubnub-react @pubnub/react-chat-components
```

2. Import PubNub, PubNub React Provider and the components.

```js
import PubNub from "pubnub";
import { PubNubProvider } from "pubnub-react";
import {
  Chat,
  MessageList,
  MessageInput,
  ChannelList,
  MemberList,
} from "@pubnub/react-chat-components";
```

3. Create your PubNub client and rest of the configuration for the `Chat` provider.

```jsx
const pubnub = new PubNub({
  publishKey: "myPublishKey",
  subscribeKey: "mySubscribeKey",
  uuid: "myUniqueUUID",
});
const currentChannel = "myCurrentChannel";
const theme = "light";
```

4. Feed the PubNub Provider with your newly created client as with other PubNub React applications.

```jsx
const MyComponent = () => {
  return <PubNubProvider client={pubnub}></PubNubProvider>;
};
```

5. Place the components within the Chat state provider in any order that your app requires.
   Components can be tweaked later on using option properties and CSS variables.

```jsx
const MyComponent = () => {
  return (
    <PubNubProvider client={pubnub}>
      <Chat {...{ currentChannel, theme }}>
        <MessageList />
        <MessageInput />
      </Chat>
    </PubNubProvider>
  );
};
```

6. Check out the [sample apps](https://pubnub.github.io/react-chat-components/samples) to see what
   is possible using the components. Source code of the sample applications can be found in the
   `samples` folder in the repository root.
