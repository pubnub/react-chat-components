# Themes

UI customization is an important part of every component library. PubNub Chat Components for React
offer many customization options depending on what kind of changes need to be applied in order to
achieve required results.

The most basic method of customizing a component is switching between built-in themes. PubNub Chat
Components for React offer light and dark modes for the three most common chat use cases. They
differ in the basic color palette and elements that are displayed or hidden on each type of chat.
These are the supported themes:

- `light` (default)
- `dark`
- `support`
- `support-dark`
- `event`
- `event-dark`

To change the default component's theme, change an appropiate option in the `Chat` provider:

```js
const MyCommponent = () => {
  return <Chat theme="dark">// Add components here</Chat>;
};
```

The following sections include screenshots showing `MessageList` in three chat use cases. These
sections also provide details on what elements were displayed in each use case and the reasoning
behind these choices.

## Group chat

This type of chat assumes a conversation between multiple entities with a medium amount of messages.
The author of each message is clearly shown, including the name and avatar, if provided. The
screenshot also shows the time when the message was sent. This type of chat most often includes
message reactions (`enableReactions`), rendered attachments, and other complex features.

## Support chat

Most often a support chat is a 1 on 1 conversation between a user and some kind of support
assistant. Messages of different authors are clearly distinguished from one another by aligning them
to different edges. The name of the interlocutor doesn't have to be shown next to the message to
save some space. Only the avatar of the support agent is shown since in most cases the end-user is
not required to provide it. You can enable or disable complex features depending on your needs.

## Event chat

Event chats are likely to show hundreds of interactions between multiple users at once. Space needs
to be preserved to show as many messages as possible on a single screen. In this case avatars and
timestamps are not displayed at all. Names are rendered next to the messages so that they can fit in
one line. It's recommended to disable complex features, like reactions, in this type of chat as they
make it harder to navigate the chat window.
