# Custom renderers

In some applications, using one of the themes and customizing it with CSS variables might not be
enough. You may need to completely change the HTML markup of the components, either to modify the
layout or add new, custom features.

If that's your case, you can use the most advanced and the most flexible option of customization -
custom renderers. Most of the components come with one or multiple properties with names ending in
`renderer`, like `messageRenderer` in the `MessageList` component.

These types of properties accept a function that should return a(n) HTML/JSX structure. Input for
the function differs depending on a particular renderer, but it's always the data used internally to
create the default markup.

## Sample usage

The code snippet below shows a sample usage of `messageRenderer` in the `MessageList` component that
was mentioned earlier. We are using it to replace the default markup of each message. The function
is fed with a message object (message itself, attachments, and reactions) along with user data. The
example assumes that the user metadata was provided along with the timestamp of the message, and a
flag determining if the current user sent this message.

> If needed, the default features, like message reactions and rendered attachments, might need to be
> implemented as well. Otherwise, they won't be shown at all.

```js
function ExampleChat() {
  const currentChannel = "example";

  const renderMessage = (props: MessageRendererProps) => {
    return (
      <div>
        <p>
          <strong>{props.message.sender?.name}</strong> {props.time}
        </p>
        <p>{props.message.message.text}</p>
      </div>
    );
  };

  return (
    <Chat currentChannel={currentChannel}>
      <MessageList fetchMessages={10} messageRenderer={renderMessage} />
    </Chat>
  );
}

export default ExampleChat;
```
